Version 2
=========

Jan 2004
--------
Moved all functions out of zane.html into Javascript include files (in INC subfolder).
Changed Zane.html to form page to get start parameters (instead of window prompts).
	FUTURE FUNCTION: Cookie based, to remember usernames and high scores (and possibly allow for saved games)
Found additional/better graphics for some monsters

Aug 2004
--------
Added variable monster graphic.  (monimg[x][y][z])  Currently supports 2 graphics for all monsters.
	Instead of 14 monster graphics, there are now 28. (1a-14a.gif and 1b-14b.gif)
	Monsters with one image have multiple copies of this image.
	Changed 06-buildtower.js, 10-checkfunction.js, and 14-setupmonster.js.  Defaults all mon[x][y][z] to "a",
		But has 50% chance of changing to "b".
	FUTURE FUNCTION: Different graphics for healthy and wounded monsters - when HP drops to particular level,
		monimg[x][y][z] can change.
